# Forming Emergent Configurations in Smart Office IoT Systems
This project is part of a Master Thesis written by Simon Gullstrand and Jonas Wahlfrid at Malmö University in the Master programme 2017.

## Description of the application 
The novel approach, Emergent Configurations of engineering IoT systems in concurrence with the developed Emergent Configurations 
architecture for the smart office environment is used to realize 
the Goal Manager component in the ECM illustrated in figure 16 as a realization in form of a system written in Java.

## Tools
### Software 
Together was used for the development of the application, to write Java code with Java SDK 8.1.

### Augmented Reality & text based instructions 
These instructions were developed in a seperate project also part of a course at Malmö University.

### Popular Science Summary
Internet of Things is a growing trend that aims to connect everything that can benefit from
being connected to the internet by providing new services and increasing the efficiency of
those Things. The Smart Office is an example of one area where the Internet of Things
concept can be applied and is popular because of the immediate advantages it brings by
having devices connected. Even though there are numerous advantages connecting devices
to the internet, there is also many challenges that need to be dealt with at all levels.
We use the novel approach Emergent Configurations to try to address the issues IoT systems
are facing. Emergent Configurations is an approach for how to engineer IoT systems,
where multiple connected devices including their functionalities and services collaborate
temporarily to achieve a common goal. Recently, researchers have introduced an abstract
architecture describing how Emergent Configurations could be implemented to carry out
its task. The main task of the Emergent Configurations is to be part of an IoT system and
handle its involved Things and people by utilizing techniques like context-awareness and
self-adaptability.
In this Master thesis we refine the abstract Emergent Configuration architecture and
realize a part of the architecture in the context of a number of real-life scenarios. We
continue to focus on the Goal Manager component, which is responsible for planning a
course of action through which the collaborating users and devices can achieve a goal.
Then we divide the Goal Manager up into a number of sub-components with the aim
of introducing a general architecture for the component. Additionally we introduce a
technique for interpreting goals, which is one of the most important responsibilities of the
Goal Manager. We hope and aim for our contributions towards the abstract architecture
of the Emergent Configurations to be used as a basis for engineering IoT systems with the
Emergent Configurations approach in the future.
